C++ Programming Practice Repository
Welcome to my C++ practice repository!


This collection contains my lab exercises, assignments, and self-practice files completed while learning the fundamentals of C++ programming. It represents my journey of developing problem-solving and logical thinking skills — the foundation for my future studies in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science.


Topics Covered
•	Input and Output
•	Conditional Statements (if-else, nested if)
•	Loops (for, while, do-while)
•	Arrays and Searching
•	Functions
•	Basic Problem Solving Assignments

Highlights
•	Assignment 1 - Question 1: A restaurant menu simulation program where the user can select food items, choose quantities, and pay in different currencies. This task helped me understand input/output operations, arithmetic, and conditional logic.
•	Assignment 1 - Question 5: An age calculator that determines the user's age in years, months, and days based on their date of birth. This exercise strengthened my understanding of arithmetic operations and modular logic.
•	Assignment 2 - Question 1: A random number guessing game where the computer generates a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. This project improved my understanding of loops, random number generation, and conditional statements.
•	For Loops and Nested Loops: Various pattern-generation programs using for loops and nested loops. These exercises significantly enhanced my grasp of iteration, control flow, and algorithmic thinking.
•	1D Arrays - Question 9: Implementation of a binary search algorithm that allows the user to find specific numbers in an array. This helped me understand search algorithms, array manipulation, and efficiency in data handling.
These exercises not only strengthened my logical reasoning and debugging skills but also encouraged me to think creatively while solving problems.


My Learning Goals
•	Pointers and Memory Management
•	Object-Oriented Programming
•	Small Projects that combine data structures and algorithms to solve practical problems
My long-term goal is to build a strong foundation in programming to pursue advanced fields such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.
